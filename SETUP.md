# Setup checklist

Everything you need to do to turn this starter into your own site. Work top to bottom.

## 1. Site config

Edit **`src/site.config.ts`** — this is the main one. Set:

- `domain` — your production URL, no trailing slash
- `name` — the logo/wordmark in the nav and footer
- `description`, `ogSiteName`, `feedDescription` — metadata and RSS titles
- `nav` — the top-nav links (label + href; anchors like `/#features` or routes like `/blog/`)
- `cta` — the primary button, reused in the nav and the hero
- `hero.heading` and `hero.subhead` — the landing-page headline and subhead
- `finalCta` — the closing CTA band (heading, text, and its own button)
- `author.name` and `author.aboutSlug` — the post author bio and its link
- `contact.email` — the footer Contact link and mailto target
- `social.sourceRepo` — the footer "Source" link
- `copyrightStartYear`

The home page (`src/pages/index.astro`) is a landing page (hero → features → final CTA); the feature cards are a placeholder array in that file. The blog list lives at `src/pages/blog/index.astro` (`/blog/`).

Then set the domain in two more places:

- **`astro.config.mjs`** → `site:` (used for canonical URLs, RSS, sitemap)
- **`public/robots.txt`** → the `Sitemap:` line

## 2. Palette & typography

The starter ships a neutral palette. Re-skin by editing the hex values in **`src/design-tokens.mjs`** (keep the token names). Preview at `/-/astro/brand/color/`. The favicon at `public/favicon.svg` uses the same colors — swap it for your own.

Type is three Google Fonts wired into Tailwind's `font-sans` / `font-serif` / `font-mono` families (serif headings, sans body, mono labels). To change them, run **`/brand-typography`** — it walks the full swap (Tailwind families, both layout font links, and the brand specimen). Preview at `/-/astro/brand/typography/`.

## 3. Content

Replace the placeholder content:

- `src/content/blog/` — `1-about-me.mdx` and `2-example-post.mdx` are examples. Keep `about-me` (or repoint `author.aboutSlug`). Higher `order` = newer.
- `src/content/resources/` — `example-resource.mdx` shows the shape. `type: "page"` makes a page; `type: "link"` is just an outbound link.
- `src/content/legal/` — `privacy.mdx` and `terms.mdx` are **placeholders, not legal advice**. Fill in the bracketed bits and review before launch.

Add content images to `src/images/`. Whenever you edit a content file, bump its `contentModifiedDate`.

## 4. Brand / design-system pages

The pages under `/-/astro/brand/` are a living style guide (internal, noindex). They use the placeholder name `My Project X` and aren't wired to `site.config`. Edit them directly — especially **`voice.astro`**, which still carries an example "house style" you'll want to rewrite for your own project.

## 5. Analytics and forms (optional but wired)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in what you use:

- **PostHog** — `PUBLIC_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN`, `PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`. Set `PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false` to turn it off in dev.
- **Brevo** — `PUBLIC_BREVO_ACCOUNT_ID`, plus a `form` block in a resource's frontmatter to show a signup form.
- **Cloudflare Turnstile** — `PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` for bot protection on forms.

All are optional — the site builds and runs without them.

## 6. Deploy

Set up hosting (the original uses Cloudflare Pages on the `main` branch — every push deploys). Update `public/_headers` and `public/_redirects` as needed. See the **Deploy & infrastructure** section in `AGENTS.md`.

## 7. Verify

```bash
npm run format
npm run check
npm run lint
npm run build
```

All four should pass clean before you push.
